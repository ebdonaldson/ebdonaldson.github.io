<p>Can a family of five survive as new colonists in the cold Alaskan environment? In Sweet Home Alaska, Terpsichore, an 11 1/2-year-old girl from Wisconsin wonders how her family, the Johnsons, will cope with her mistake. In a pact with her friend, she ensured the family’s moving to Alaska, thinking that her friend was coming, too. Now, with her friend left behind in Wisconsin and her family of five relocated to a tent in Alaska, Terpsichore struggles to manage in her present conditions. During the story, Terpsichore finds a couple of friends, Mendel and Gloria, who help her mom, siblings and her adjust to their new environment. This was an attention-grabbing, thought-provoking paperback. With emotional plot twists every few pages, the lifelike and bright main character Terpsichore, along with her twin siblings, Calliope (Cally) and Polymnia (Polly), and friends, Mendel and Gloria, find plenty of hidden humor in their experiences.</p>
<p>Something the reader learns about the main character is that she is a strong person—both physically and mentally. One example of this is her cutting of a chunk of pumpkin big enough to feed all six members of her family. In this part of the story, Terpsichore demonstrates her physical strength. Near the end of the story, she demonstrates her mental strength by creating a library, selling wares, and making profits to buy her mother a piano. These examples really show the complexity and strength of the character Carole Estby Dagg created. Terpsichore Johnson is a truly humble, tough, and reliable character who moves beyond her dire circumstances to make meaningful connections and contributions to her Alaskan community.</p>
<p>One component of the book was perplexing—the author includes Terpsichore’s letter to Eileen in the book. It’s basically a list of Terpsichore’s feelings about her Alaskan home. The structure and the real purpose of the letter are unclear—particularly when it goes unanswered. Also, I don’t get enough background information on who Eileen is, or how she and Terpsichore became such close friends. I am also puzzled as to why Mendel briefly splits up with Gloria and Terpsichore but rejoins their group just as quickly. What is the author’s purpose for putting Terpsichore with this particular group of friends: a fashion enthusiast and a bug know-it-all? Why is Eileen so briefly introduced into the story as Terpsichore’s friend from Wisconsin and then her name is removed from the story entirely, except for a few fleeting feelings Terpsichore has about her? This makes me feel like there should have been a prologue, or a prequel to this story, because the reader does not really get to know anything about Eileen or her personality, or her relationship with Terpsichore.</p>
<p>This book would interest a reader who likes historical fiction. As this book takes place around 1953, when the Matanuska experimental colony popped up, you get to learn about pioneer life in Alaska. I think the author did a great job on her second book, but I prefer more detailed character descriptions. She does, however, show people collaborating on a communal job to build a town. With no existing facilities to help them, these people worked together to create a safe, warm town. In this book you can learn valuable lessons about hard work, strength, and community participation. Overall, the characters, humor, and vivid details about struggles make Sweet Home Alaska an enjoyable and entertaining read.</p>
