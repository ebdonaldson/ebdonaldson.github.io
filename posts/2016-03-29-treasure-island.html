<p>On a ship full of pirates and buccaneers, who can you trust? Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island explores this question through the high sea adventures of a tavern boy named Jim Hawkins, the novel’s protagonist. When a mysterious sea dog, Billy Bones, happens into Jim’s family’s tavern with an old sea chest, Jim is unexpectedly swept up into a hunt for treasure and forthright comrades.</p>
<p>En route to Treasure Island, Jim meets Long John Silver. Silver is nice to Jim. He gives Jim extra food and makes friendly remarks. Jim believes he’s found someone he can trust and befriend. But as they say, don’t judge a book by its cover, or as I would say, think before you trust. The reader gets to see Jim not only navigate the seas, but also potentially dangerous relationships.</p>
<p>Treasure Island was written a long time ago in 1883. Words like “thy,” “ye,” and “thou,” are used throughout. This may make it difficult to read, as these words may be somewhat foreign and hard to understand. But if ye stick with it, ye’ll have read a great adventure. I would recommend this book for ye who are ready for pirate battles, treasure hunting, and deciphering olde English.</p>
