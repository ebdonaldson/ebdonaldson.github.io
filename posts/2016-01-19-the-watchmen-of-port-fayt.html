<p>Do you believe trolls, elves, fairies, goblins, dwarves, imps, ogres, and humans can coexist? Conrad Mason explores this question in his high-fantasy adventure The Watchmen of Port Fayt. As villainous forces backed by humans known as the “League of Light” plot to destroy Port Fayt and its nonhuman inhabitants, a boy goblin named Joseph and a confident human girl named Tabitha are brought together to save Port Fayt.</p>
<p>Our main characters protect their community and oppose the League of Light - who believe humans are the purest of all beings, and everyone else is a “mere perversion”. Until recently, Port Fayt has been safe and protected by underground watchmen, but now the League of Light’s harsh laws on trade have begun to anger important officials and there is threat of war. To avert war, the two protagonists struggle against betrayal, shape shifters, and smugglers before finally reaching their goal.</p>
<p>Conrad Mason raises many contrasting ideas in his book, representing nearly everyone’s opinion. At times, these multiple vantage points left me confused because the author looks at the notion of co-existence through not only the protagonists’ eyes, but also the governor’s, a toy shop owner’s, and many more characters. It is overwhelming to be flooded with so many different ideas, and difficult to feel confident about any “ethical answer.” However, the book was quite successful at painting vivid pictures in my mind of Port Fayt and its mythical creatures. It also held my interest because it has a complex, plot filled with realistic characters and struggles. Joseph and Tabitha’s alliance stirs up many real-world questions, offers some answers, and chronicles problems and triumphs even though it is centered around fantasy, legends, sorcery and monsters.</p>
<p>Conrad Mason’s story evolves to describe humans intermarrying, creating, and celebrating with mythical beings. They make lasting friendships, become united, gain more courage, and realize they have the power to save and change their community together. You should read The Watchmen of Port Fayt to get lost in this amazing fantasy and to embrace the importance of tolerance, and developing alliances for growth and stability.</p>
